# Bootkamp-Midterm-Project-2025-NYU-
Midterm project for NYU data class on financial modeling.

 We used a news API to find the most relevant news articles and then found the most mentioned ticker. Then using  Yahoo Finance, we managed to assemble a dcf valuation using balance sheets, and other financial statements and basic formulation. We did this to predict what apple should be worth today, based on its expected future cashflows. Fianlly, we used CAPM to measure how the apple stock has performed in the past relative to its risk which tells us if apple is a good investment compared to the market.
